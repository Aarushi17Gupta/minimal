### Melanoma Detection

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

### Telecom Churn Case Study

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

### House Price Prediction using Regularization (Ridge and Lasso Regression)

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

### Bike Sharing Demand Prediction (Multiple Linear Regression)

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Analysis of Mortgage-Backed Securities Prepayment Ability

A Machine Learning Project that can predict whether the customer will default the loan or not. The primary dataset is Feddie Mac's Single Family Loan-Level Dataset.This dataset contains approximately 500,000 mortgages originated between January 1, 1999 and September 30th, 2020. The dataset mainly consists of fixed-rate single family mortgages loans with a maturity of thirty years.

### Exploratory Data Analysis on LendingClub Case Study

The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) . Thus, we have to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

### Recommendation System Deployment Through Streamlit

A General purpose Recommender System that can recommend any items such as Movies, Receipes, Books and MOOCs. Used cosine similarity, TF-IDF Vectorization and K Nearest Neighbours to recommend top items from a list of large items. At the end, deployed the machine learning model using Streamlit Sharing to create a Recommender System application.
